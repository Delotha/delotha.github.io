# About Delotha

I am Ryan Loudfoot and Delotha is my small company. I'm an amateur Linux system administrator. I help small companies manage their Linux servers using Puppet/Foreman and monitoring them with Zabbix.

I also help people with their websites, but mostly that's related to the technical parts (installing WordPress and making sure it's up) these days.

I use Git to manage my Puppet configuration(s) and some custom modules, but these aren't on GitHub for security reasons. I do have my (very basic) custom backup script available on GitHub [under my company](https://github.com/Delotha), but the configuration scripts for it are not there.

I'm not formally trained as a system administrator, but I have taught myself many of the methodologies to be effective, mostly by maintaining simplicity in my processes. This helps me keep my servers and configs clean and easy-to-understand.
