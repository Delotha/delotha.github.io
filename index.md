## Company Info

- Delotha Consulting is a very small company made up of just me, [Ryan Loudfoot](https://github.com/Elyrith){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, for now.
- I'm an amateur Linux system administrator and programmer. I help small companies manage their Linux servers using [Salt](https://saltproject.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), and sometimes [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. I also help them monitor their infrastructure using [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, but I used to use [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
- I taught myself how to be a system administrator, finding joy in streamlining tasks for better efficiency. Thanks to the power of the software above and picking up Python along the way, I've significantly boosted my effectiveness. Keeping things simple is key for me, making sure my home network and business infrastructure stay easy to manage.
- For my home network, I learned how to configure switches with VLANs, access ports and trunks, and a small variety of other required pieces of info to keep my IoT devices, security cameras, and other networks secure, while still having access to the other devices and networks they need. I use [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} along with TP-Link network equipment to try to get as close to enterprise-grade equipment and processes without paying enterprise prices.
- I run running [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for DNS ad blocking network-wide.

## My Projects

I use Git (GitHub and privage GitLab repos) to manage my own company and home infrastructure, such as:

- [Salt](https://saltproject.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} master and salt pillar configurations. (Private)
- [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} server configurations. (Private)
- Ansible configurations. (Private)
- A very basic [custom backup script](https://github.com/Delotha/server-scripts){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (The configuration scripts for it are managed privately with Salt.)
- A [basic Discord bot in Python](https://github.com/Elyrith/py-discordbot){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which I used to help me learn Python and accessing APIs, while offering communication tools for my friends and I about when we are playing games so we can get more of us together at once.
- An automation script to automatically deploy my customer's application for their new client. This Python program utilizes the customer's ticketing system to get the new client's info, then creates a database, website files, and Apache hosting files. (Private)
- [Two](https://github.com/Elyrith/project-zomboid-guns-blazin){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} [mods](https://github.com/Elyrith/project-zomboid-everything-weighs-nothing){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for a game called [Project Zomboid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
