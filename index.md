# Delotha Consulting

Delotha Consulting is a very small company made up of just me, [Ryan Loudfoot](https://github.com/Elyrith), for now. I'm an amateur Linux system administrator and programmer. I help small companies manage their Linux servers using [Salt](https://saltproject.io/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), and sometimes [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/). I also help them monitor their infrastructure using [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/), but I used to use [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/).

I also help people with their websites, but mostly that's related to the technical parts (installing and assiting with WordPress, making sure the site is up and secure, and maintaining the infrastructure) these days.

I'm not formally trained as a system administrator (in school), but since 2007 I have taught myself many of the methodologies to be effective, mostly by maintaining simplicity in my processes and implementing them in my own home network and business infrastructure. This helps me keep my servers and configs clean and easy-to-understand.

My Projects:

I use Git (GitHub and even more private git repos on my servers) to manage my own company and home infrastructure.

I wrote a very basic [custom backup script](https://github.com/Delotha/server-scripts), but the configuration scripts for it are managed privately with Salt.

I have written a [basic Discord bot in Python](https://github.com/Elyrith/py-discordbot), which I used to help me learn Python and accessing APIs, while offering communication tools for my friends and I about when we are playing games so we can get more of us together at once.

I wrote an automation script for one of my customers to automatically deploy their application for their new customers. The script utilizes the customer's ticketing system to get the new customer's info, then creates a database, website files, and Apache hosting files.

I wrote [two](https://github.com/Elyrith/project-zomboid-guns-blazin) [mods](https://github.com/Elyrith/project-zomboid-everything-weighs-nothing) for a game called [Project Zomboid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid/).
